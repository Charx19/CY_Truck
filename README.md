# CY_Truck
This project was made by HICHAM, ABHISHEK, and CHARLES

Our project was to simulate that we ran a transportation company. Our goal was to take the data of all the drivers and trips made throughout the last few years and make accurate histograms to visualize the data.
We made 5 different types of options : 
  - d<1/2>: to filter by the number of trips made per the top 10 drivers or the total distance per the top 10 drivers
  - L: The total distance per driver ID
  - T: The top 10 most traveled cities 
  - S: The minimal, maximal, et average distance per trip 

Each of these options will send back a histogram (d1,d2, L, and T ) and S will send a graph
